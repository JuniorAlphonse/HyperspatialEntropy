# HyperspatialEntropy&InformationCommunication
This project will host the code for natural physical codes pertaining to the advance of Science and The Scientific Method (hopefully).

## Code's Purpose
This project will attempt to verify whether or not information transferrence is limited to the observable universe or whether or not our universe is alone. This loneliness is dependent on the presence of a hyperspatial vaccum and0 or other universes in said unknown spaces. It will also attempts to unify Boltzmann's Entropy with Shannon's Informative Entropy. This code may rely on an introduction to Information Entropy found at the following link: https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-is-information-entropy/. Thanks to said introduction, astrophysicists, cosmologists, mathematicians, electrical, mechanical, and aerospace engineers may determine the feasibility of interspatial travel through presupposed warp drives or elsewise. Additional guidance was sought from a paper by the University of Houston, which can be found at the following link: https://www.math.uh.edu/~etgen/ComplexNos.pdf. The following definition of real numbers was also applicable: https://www.britannica.com/science/real-number.

### Technologies
1. Python (Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or Anaconda)
2. Matplotlib & pyplot
3. (pending Ethical Quantum AI!)

#### Installation and Usage Instructions
This program requires the latest editions of VS Code or the equivalent in Anaconda's Jupyter Notebook services. This code is highly experimentially and would not qualify for a version dot 1.0 yet but may soon be so given time. For now, it is best used for theoretical postulations and materials testing for pending interstellar Missions. The eventual is to create a system interface for a warp drive space shuttle or spacecraft or a fleet of such.
