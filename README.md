# HyperspatialEntropy
This is an intermediately intensive exploration of entropy for tangential surfaces for five or more dimensions, as well as whether or not it is possible to communicate information between universes and the, temporarily, unobservable.

## HyperspatialEntropy&InformationCommunication
This project will host the code for natural physical codes pertaining to the advance of Science and The Scientific Method (hopefully).

### Code's Purpose
This project will attempt to verify whether or not information transferrence is limited to the observable universe or whether or not our universe is alone. This loneliness is dependent on the presence of a hyperspatial vaccum and or other universes in said unknown spaces. It will also attempts to unify Boltzmann's Entropy with Shannon's Informative Entropy. This code may rely on an introduction to Information Entropy found at the following link: https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-is-information-entropy/. Thanks to said introduction, astrophysicists, cosmologists, mathematicians, electrical, mechanical, and aerospace engineers may determine the feasibility of interspatial travel through presupposed warp drives or elsewise. Additional guidance was sought from a paper by the University of Houston, which can be found at the following link: https://www.math.uh.edu/~etgen/ComplexNos.pdf. The following definition of real numbers was also applicable: https://www.britannica.com/science/real-number.

#### Technologies
