# Q1: Is The Second Law of Thermodyanmics is mandatory for "superpentaspaces" (such that dimensionalities are a total of five or more spacetime usually with 3 or more spatial dimensions, with at least one, but preferably, three or more time dimensions) or do different laws apply to manifolds and therefore spatial dimension cappers, as well as temporal dimensional cappers?

# The purpose of the following proability_list to display the likelihood of a few given configurations for Information Theory. These few have far reaching meaninings. The first microstate given below defines the probability of encountering spatial, as from spacetime, information that can be observed by measurement. The second probability represents the probability of measuring both spatial and temporal phenomena and or epiphenomena, such as time travel as one or one's vehicle approaches a sizeable portion of the speed of light. The third probability displays the certainty of the dimensions four through nine, or ten if M-theory is found to be observable. A probability of higher than 1.0 verifies that all dimensions, of spatial, temporal, and compact dimensions are probabilistically certain. 
# Knowing that a microstate information of 1.0 means that an outcome is certain and therefore required to occur. Then summing the probabilities of the spatial, temporal, and compact dimensions and having essentially 300% certainty verifies that all proposed dimensionalities must exist or the graph would not be not possible on a classiscal computer, not to mention a quantum computer.

# Note that despite the fact that probability typically has a max value of 1.00, or 100%, values of two and three are displayed. These values are relatively to the definition of superposition as modified by Junior Alphonse from a classical mechanical reimagining of the Einsteinian special relativity. This reimagining allows for the
